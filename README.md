# ausplotsR
R package in development for extraction, preparation, visualisation and analysis of TERN AusPlots ecosystem monitoring data.

When complete, users will be able to access data directly through the R package, with simple function calls to extract the data and merge them into species occurrence matrices for analysis or to calculate things like basal area and fractional cover.

Not that the package is currently set up to read local files only.

To install the package, use:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("gregguerin/ausplotsR")
```
