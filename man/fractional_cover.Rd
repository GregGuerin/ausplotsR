\details{Cover fractions are assigned according to the following:
	
'Green' or 'photosynthetic vegetation' is living vascular plant cover.

'Brown' or 'non-photosynthetic vegetation' is either vascular plant cover scored as 'dead' or substrate scored as litter, coarse woody debris or cryptogam (see below) that has no other veg cover.

'Bare' or 'bare ground' is substrate that is rock, outcrop, gravel or bare soil with no veg cover.

A height rule is applied so that coding to green/brown/bare of the uppermost substrate/vegetation stratum hit at a given point intercept location overrides the others, that is, a dead tree overrides a living shrub beneath; substrate coding is overriden by any vegetation cover etc. This means for each of the (usually) 1010 intercepts, there is a single coding and percentage is the number of hits assigned to each fraction, divided by the total number of PIs taken (usually 1010 but can vary) times 100.

#There is an option in argument 'ground_fractional' to calculate fractional ground cover - the same concept applied to only grasses (hummock, tussock, other); sedge; rush; forb; fern; vine - presently excluded; cryptogam - presently included in non-photosynthetic fraction

#'In canopy sky' is excluded by default (only the substrate is considered for those hits) and applies only to regular fractional cover (as trees are excluded in the green fraction for ground fractional cover by default)

#Currently, cryptogam substrate is assigned to the non-photosynthetic fraction but this could be changed or made an option

#Occasionally substrate type was not collected ('NC') or could not be assigned to one of the above categories ('Unknwn'), in which case a percent cover will be returned under an 'NA' fraction if there was no veg cover above
