\title{Graphical illustration of TERN AusPlots data.
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{Generates a set of default graphical displays representing TERN AusPlots data based on geographic locations and vegetation attritubes from the plot-based point intercepts (as generated by \code{\link{get_ausplots}}).
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
ausplots_visual(my.ausplots.object = NULL, map = TRUE, map.attribute = TRUE, fraction.pie = TRUE, growthform.pie = TRUE, cumulative_cover = TRUE, whittaker = TRUE, outfile=NULL, max.plots = 5)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{my.ausplots.object}{Optional input raw data object as generated in a call from the \code{\link{get_ausplots}} function. The default graphical outputs require $site.info (for locations) and $veg.PI (for vegetation attributes) to be included in the AusPlots data extract.

%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{map}{Logical, whether to include a basic map of site locations in the context of Australia.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
  \item{map.attribute}{Logical, whether to include a map depicting site locations in Australia coded by cover of trees over 5 m high.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{fraction.pie}{Logical, whether to include pie charts depicting \code{\link{fractional_cover}}.
}
\item{growthform.pie}{Logical, whether to include pie charts depicting relative cover of plant growth forms.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{cumulative_cover}{Logical, whether to include graphs of cumulative cover by species as point intercepts are taken across the plot.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{whittaker}{Logical, whether to include Whittaker plots depicting  species abundance distributions.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{outfile}{Optional file path and name to which the output pdf file is written. 
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{max.plots}{The maximum number of sites for which to display individual graphics. By default, these are selected randomly, but if user provides data, sites are taken in order. Fractional and cumulative cover can be slow to calculate across a large number of plots and the output file will be very large. 
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
}
\details{By default, extracts sample data, allowing the user to explore the dataset in a single call, or to easily visualise an extracted AusPlots dataset. Included in the default demonstration plots are maps plot locations with and without coding by tree cover, and then set of four plots for a smaller sample of plot depicting data from the main vegetation tables in the package, fractional cover, growth form cover, species cover and species relative abundance. This function is intended as a simple demonstration of the data available. Refer to TERN tutorials for many other wasys to visualise and explore AusPlots.

\value{Plots are written to a pdf file, by default in the working directory.
