\title{Graphical visualisation of TERN AusPlots data.
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{Generates a set of default graphical displays representing TERN AusPlots data or user-defined subset based on geographic locations and/or vegetation attritubes from the plot-based point intercepts (as generated by \code{\link{get_ausplots}}). By default, extracts sample data, allowing the user to explore the dataset in a single call, or easily visualise an extract AusPlots dataset.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
ausplots_visual(my.ausplots.object = NULL, map = TRUE, map.attribute = TRUE, fraction.pie = TRUE, growthform.pie = TRUE, cumulative_cover = TRUE, whittaker = TRUE, outfile=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{my.ausplots.object}{Optional input raw data object as generated in a call from the \code{\link{get_ausplots}} function. The default graphical outputs require $site.info (for locations) and $veg.PI (for vegetation attributes) to be included in the AusPlots data extract.

%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{map}{Logical, whether to include a basic map of site locations in the context of Australia.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
  \item{map.attribute}{Logical, whether to include maps depicting selected vegetation attributes, such as cover of trees over 5 m high.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{fraction.pie}{Logical, whether to include pie charts depicting \code{\link{fractional_cover}}.
}
\item{growthform.pie}{Logical, whether to include pie charts depicting relative cover of plant growth forms.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{cumulative_cover}{Logical, whether to include graphs of cumulative cover by species as point intercepts are taken across the plot.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{whittaker}{Logical, whether to include Whittaker plots depicting  species abundance distributions.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{whittaker}{Optional filepath and name to write output pdf file to. 
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
