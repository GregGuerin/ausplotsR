\title{Species occurrence matrices for AusPlots
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{This function takes a data frame of individual raw point intercept hits from AusPlots generated using the get_ausplots function, and generates species occurrence matrices as desired based on presence/absence, cover, frequencey or IVI index.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
species_table(veg.PI, m_kind="percent_cover", cover_type="PFC")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{veg.PI}{The input raw point intercept data generated by get_ausplots
%%     ~~Describe \code{my.Plot_IDs} here~~
}
  \item{m_kind}{The desired species scoring method: PA: binary (presence/absence), percent cover, frequency (based on occurrences on transects within plots) or IVI (combination of cover and frequency).
#
%%     ~~Describe \code{site_info} here~~
}
  \item{cover_type}{A choice between PFC: 'projected foliage cover' and OCC: 'opaque canopy cover' and only applies to percent_cover and IVI. If 'PFC' is selected, hits scored as 'in canopy sky' are removed, whereas they are retained as cover for that species for 'OCC'
%%     ~~Describe \code{structural_summaries} here~~
}
}
\details{The output matrix can be converted to long format (with rows as species records) using:
#my.matrix <- species_table(my.veg.PI, m_kind="PA", cover_type="PFC")
#library(reshape2)
#my.matrix <- as.data.frame(melt(as.matrix(my.matrix)))
#my.matrix <- my.matrix[-which(my.matrix $value == 0),]

%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~

\value{Returns a species against sites table as a data frame.

%%  If it is a LIST, use
