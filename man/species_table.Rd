\title{Species occurrence matrices for AusPlots
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{This function takes a data frame of individual raw point intercept hits from AusPlots generated using the \code{\link{get_ausplots}} function, and generates species occurrence matrices as desired based on presence/absence, cover, frequencey or IVI index.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
species_table(veg.PI, m_kind=c("PA", "percent_cover", "freq", "IVI"),
	cover_type=c("PFC", "OCC"))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{veg.PI}{The input raw point intercept data generated by \code{\link{get_ausplots}}
%%     ~~Describe \code{my.Plot_IDs} here~~
}
  \item{m_kind}{The desired species scoring method: PA: binary (presence/absence), percent cover, frequency (based on occurrences on transects within plots) or IVI (combination of cover and frequency).
%%     ~~Describe \code{site_info} here~~
}
  \item{cover_type}{A choice between PFC: 'projected foliage cover' and OCC: 'opaque canopy cover' and only applies to percent_cover and IVI. If 'PFC' is selected, hits scored as 'in canopy sky' are removed, whereas they are retained as cover for that species for 'OCC'
%%     ~~Describe \code{structural_summaries} here~~
}
}
\details{Users should be aware that herbarium determinations are provided by state herbariums and are the most commonly used scientific names in the given state. However, scientific names may vary between states due to disagreements on taxonomy/nomenclature. Herbarium determinations are also made to the lowest possible taxonomic level, which, depending on the quality of the vegetation voucher sample, may be at the family, genus, species, subspecies or variety level. Therefore, while the majority of the raw point intercept hits record the "Genus species", occurrence matrices will include a mix of taxonomic levels, not all of which are at the species level.


The returned occurrence matrix (species against sites) can be converted to long format (with rows as species records) using:

\code{

my.matrix <- species_table(my.veg.PI, m_kind="PA", cover_type="PFC"); 
library(reshape2); 
my.matrix <- as.data.frame(melt(as.matrix(my.matrix))); 
my.matrix <- my.matrix[-which(my.matrix $value == 0),]

}

The \code{\link{round}} function can be used on the returned matrix to estimate percent covers to the nearest percent if desired (i.e., with digits=0)
