\title{Total vegetation cover by height or growth form using TERN AusPlots data.
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{Calculates a single vegetation cover value per site based on the plot-based point intercept data from AusPlots (as generated by \code{\link{get_ausplots}}). Cover can be subsetted to vegetation over a specified height and/or by plant growth forms, allowing user defined definitions of e.g. grass or tree cover. For example, by default, forest cover is calculated per plot for tree growth forms of 5 metres or higher.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
single_cover_value(veg.PI, in_canopy_sky=FALSE, by.growth_form=TRUE, min.height=5, my.growth_forms=c("Tree/Palm", "Tree Mallee"))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{veg.PI}{The input raw point intercept data ($veg.PI) as generated in the \code{\link{get_ausplots}} function.

%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{in_canopy_sky}{Logical, whether to include in canopy sky hits to calculate opaque canopy cover instead of projected foliage cover. Set to TRUE to calculate opaque canopy cover.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
  \item{by.growth_form}{Logical, whether to subset by plant growth form. If set to FALSE then only height subsetting occurs. Set to TRUE to calculate cover subsetted to specified growth forms.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
\item{min.height}{Numeric, sets the height in m below which PI hits are ignored. This argument is used to calculate e.g. cover of trees 5 m high or higher.
}
\item{my.growth_forms}{A user-suppled character vector specifying growth forms to include in the cover calculation. Defaults to trees. Applies only when by.growth_form=TRUE, otherwise this argument is ignored and only the height rule is applied. For allowable growth forms, see \code{unique(veg.PI$growth_form)}.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
}
\details{All included point intercept hits are merged to give a single cover value with a maximum of 100. Cover partitioned by multiple plant growth forms can be calculated using \code{growth_form_table}, by species using \code{species_table} and fractional green/brown/bare cover using \code{fractional_cover}.
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{Returns a data frame in which plots are rows identified by a unique site and visit identifier ('site_unique') and the returned cover value is given in the $percentCover column.
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
