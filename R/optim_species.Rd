The function operates under the ‘Maximum coverage problem’ framework, by which the user sets the number of plots to select and the function selects them to represent the largest number of species in the given number of sites.}\usage{optim_species(x, n.plt=250, start="fixed", plot_name= NULL, plot=TRUE, richness=TRUE, RRR=TRUE, CWE=TRUE, shannon=TRUE, simpson=TRUE, simpson_beta=TRUE, frequent=TRUE, random=TRUE, iterations=10) {	\arguments{  \item{x}{data frame, species versus sites matrix, where rows are sites and columns are species. The first column must be the sites names. Depending on the desired optimiser the data input needs to be presence/absence or abundance. For richness, RRR, CWE, and simpson_beta optimisers, a presence/absence input matrix is required. For shannon and simpson optimisers, an abundance matrix is required}  \item{n.plt}{Number of plots n conforming the subset to be optimised}  \item{start}{Choose under which condition the first plot is selected. If "fixed", the plot with the greatest species richness is chosen as a start. If "random", a random plot is selected as a start. If "defined" the user assigns a specific starting plot. Notice that if start = "defined" then the plot_name argument must be provided. By default “fixed” is selected a start seed.}  \item{plot_name}{Specific plot to start the optimisation when the user has selected start = "defined". By default plot_name = NULL.

Best used when the goal is to identify biodiversity hotspots. Range rarity richness is a rarity-weighted richness calculated as the inverse of the number of sites in which a species occur. Best used when the goal is to identify areas of high biodiversity and biological uniqueness. Corrected Weight Endemism is best used when the goal is to identify centers of endemism highlighting range-restricted species. It is calculated as range rarity richness (RRR) divided by species richness. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index combines species richness and the evenness or equitability by computing the species’ relative abundances. It is calculated as: H^'= -?_(i=1)^S¦?p_i ?log?_n p_i ?, where S is the species richness and pi is the relative abundance of the species. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index assumes that all species are represented in a sample and that they are randomly sampled. The Simpson diversity index combines species richness and the evenness or equitability by computing the species’ relative abundances. It is calculated as: D= 1/?_(i=1)^S¦?p_i  ^2 ? , where S is the species richness and pi is the relative abundance of the species. The Simpson diversity index is a dominance index, giving more weight tocommon or dominant species. The Simpson dissimilarity is based ? diversity partitioning, which separates species replacement (i.e. turnover) from species loss (i.e. nestedness). The Simpson dissimilarity corresponds to the turnover component of the Sorensen dissimilarity. It is used to maximise species turnover. By default, the function will extract and compile data from the top n selected plots based on all the different optimisers. The starting seed by default will be the one with the highest value of species richness. Arguments allow the user to select the number of plots to optimized, the desired optimisers to implement and the starting seed plot for the optimisation. The lists returned by the function will specify the top selected plots according to each of the optimisers, as well as the cumulative species when employing each of them. Additionally, the function will plot by default of the species cumulative curves obtained by the different optimisers.}
